Memory Card Game and Weather API Request

Developed a React application with two interactive tabs: 

Memory Card Game: it's a card matching game to enhance memory skills. I have Implemented game logic to shuffle cards, manage user selections, and track matched pairs by using state management to handle game state, including the number of moves and matches. 

Weather Information App: Created a web service to fetch and display real-time weather data using the Tomorrow.io API by Implementing state management with useState and managed API requests with axios. Utilized React Bootstrap for UI components, including forms and modals for user interactions.
